## 🚀 About Me

I build software that connects users directly to decentralized systems.  
My current focus is **DeFi protocol development** — designing and securing **on-chain yield strategies** and **smart-contract infrastructure**.  

I enjoy bridging on-chain logic with real-world user interfaces — writing Solidity contracts, connecting them via APIs, and crafting intuitive dApps.

### 💱 **African Currency Swap Platform**
**Solidity • Next.js • Ethers.js • Hardhat**  
A decentralized exchange enabling swaps between African fiat-pegged tokens — inspired by **Uniswap V2** architecture.  
- Implements **automated market-maker (AMM)** liquidity pools and pricing via constant product formula  
- Users can provide liquidity and earn fees in local stablecoin pairs (e.g., `NGN/KES`, `GHS/ZAR`)  
- Integrated frontend for swap execution, pool creation, and analytics  
- Focus on **gas efficiency** and **modular pair factory** design for expansion across African regions
